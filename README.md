# scaleid
This simply app identifies the triads of a tone, its four most important scales and shows the notes in the guitar neck.
It was made with Javascript, HTML, CSS and a bit of Jquery. The proposal is to study git's workflow in a practical way using as
few frameworks as possible and share some musical knowledge. Hope you guys like it and any help or comment will be welcome.
